# Javelin Throw Simulation

## Overview

Javelin Throw Simulation is a project designed to model the physics of javelin throwing. The project focuses on deriving the mathematical relationship between the terminal distance, launching speed, and firing angle of the javelin. Using Python and PyQt, we simulate the trajectory of the javelin based on these parameters, providing an interactive visualization and analysis tool.

## Features

- Derivation of the mathematical model relating terminal distance to launching speed and firing angle
- Calculation of the optimum firing angle for maximum distance
- Interactive simulation of the javelin's trajectory
- User inputs for launching speed and firing angle
- Output of the calculated throwing distance
- Motion display speed control for the simulation

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For mathematical modeling, calculations, and simulation
- **PyQt**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and visualizing the javelin's trajectory

## Project Structure

- `javelin_project.py`: The main script that runs the simulation
- `ui.py`: Handles the GUI using PyQt
- `Project Report`: Directory containing the technical report with model design, mathematical derivations, and references

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 
- PyQt5

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RanaHany10/Javelin_Throw_Simulation.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pyqt5
   ```

### Running the Simulation

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python javelin_project.py
   ```

2. Input the desired launching speed and firing angle in the GUI.

3. Observe the javelin's trajectory and the calculated throwing distance.
